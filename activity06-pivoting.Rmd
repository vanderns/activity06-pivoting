## Data and packages

Again, we will load all of the `{tidyverse}` for this activity.

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

In this activity we will explore the differences between human-readable datasets (untidy data) and computer-readable datasets (tidy data).
Before making any visualizations, it is important to understand whether the data we have is tidy or not.


In this activity you will be working with data from the popular tv sitcom Friends.
Transcripts for all 10 seasons of the show were parsed and all utterances are broken down by season, episode, and scene.
The `by_speaker` dataset summarizes the total number of words spoken by main character for each season.

![FRIENDS tv show logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Friends_logo.svg/1186px-Friends_logo.svg.png)

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
by_speaker <- read_csv(here::here("data","by_speaker.csv"))
```

In the `load_-_data` chunk, notice that I am using a new function: the `here` function from `{here}` (typed as `here::here` or in `<package>::<function>` format).
This function is a another great tool to use for sharing projects with others when their file structure might be different than yours.
Read Jenny Bryan's [Ode to the here package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) and/or read more about `{here}`... [here](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html).
Also, Martin Chan provides a guide of [RStudio Projects and Working Directories](https://martinctc.github.io/blog/rstudio-projects-and-working-directories-a-beginner's-guide/) and Jenny Richmond gives an overview on [How to use the `here` package](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/how-to-use-the-here-package/).

In short, folder structures vary from [computer-to-computer and user-to-user](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#paths-and-directories).
RStudio Projects are one great way to make sure that others that use your code won't have to worry about the path to files within the Project folder.
Then, `{here}` will always recognizes the top-level directory of your RStudio project!
Type `here::here()` in your **Console** to verify that it is recognizing your current project is located at `.../activity06-pivoting` (your front matter will be different than mine, but it should end with this project folder).

Now, why is `by_speaker` untidy data?
How would this data be organized if it were tidy?
Do not use any of your new `{tidyr}` skills yet, only describe it.

## Analysis

### Gather the... I mean `pivot_longer` the data 

From before, I hope that it was evident that the variable *Season* is spread across multiple columns and *Words* count is stored within the cell values for these columns.
Therefore, to "tidy-fy" these data we need to reshape the information contained in columns `Season 1` through `Season 10`.
One way to do this is as follows:

```{r pivot_season_longer}
friends_tidy <- by_speaker %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `Season 1`:`Season 10`,
    names_to = "Season",
    values_to = "Words"
  )

friends_tidy
```

Notice that the columns for each season have a space in them: "Season"SPACE"Number".
To be able to use column names with spaces, we need to encapsulate them in backticks (the tickmark above your Tab key).
Also notice that I am directing the names of these old columns (`Season 1` through `Season 10`) to a new column called `Season`. Since I am creating this new column, I need to encapsulate the name in quotation marks.
Similarly with directing the values to a new `Words` column.

There are a number of helper functions to help with selecting columns.

1. Try reproducing the pivoted data in the `pivot_season_longer` code chunck using either the `contains` or `starts_with` helper functions from `{tidyselect}` (this is loaded with the `{tidyverse}` by default).
Remember that you can view the help documentation by using the `?` method in your **Console**.
2. Assign your reformatted dataset to `friends_tidy`, and 
3. Name your code chunk either `pivot_contains` or `pivot_ends` depending on which helper function you used.




### Save the dataset

Now that we have this tidy dataset, we might want to share this with a collaborator or use in alternative analysis or visualization tools.
We can do this by writing it to a file within our directory.

1. Using the `write_csv` and `here::here` functions, write the `friends_tidy` dataset to the `data` folder.
2. Call the file that is being created "`friends_tidy.csv`".
3. Name your code chunk `writing_file`




Inspect that this file was created by looking in the `data` project folder in the **Files** pane.
You should see three files: `by_speaker.csv`, `by_season.csv`, and `friends_tidy.csv`.
Simply verifying that it exists is sufficient.

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Try it another way

While exploring the `data` project folder, there should have also been an additional data files: `by_season.csv`.
This is the same information that we were just worked with, but structured in a different way.

1. Write the code that reads in the data file.
2. Assign this data file into meaningful objects.
3. Name this code chunk `read_season_file`.




Now, 

1. Pivot the `by_season` dataset so that it is now tidy,
2. Assign it to an object called `speaker_tidy`, and
3. Name the code chunk `pivot_speaker`.




#### Total words spoken

Using `by_season` and your skills from past activities, write the code that computes the total number of words spoken by each season and the total words spoken across the series (challenge, can you display this information in one table?).
Name this code chunk `season_summary`.



Using `by_speaker` and your skills from past activities, write the code that computes the total number of words spoken by each season and the total words spoken across the series (challenge, can you display this information in one table?).
Name this code chunk `speaker_summary`.



Using the `friends_tidy` object and your skills from past activities, write the code that computes the total number of words spoken by each season and the total words spoken across the series (challenge, can you display this information in one table?).
Call this code chunk `tidy_summary`



How does the code for `friends_tidy` compare to the two `by_` code?
Reflect on the process of writing this code and on the code itself.
Which is easier to write?
Which is easier to read?

**Response**:

#### Preparing tables

So far, we have taken a variable spread across multiple variables (e.g., word counts for each character) and pivoted so that we have tidy data where, 

1. Each observation is its own row,
2. Each variable is its own column, and
3. Each value has its own cell.

Now we will use `pivot_wider` to "untidy-fy" data.
You may be wondering, "but you just said untidy data is bad..."
However, like the tables that we started off with, untidy data is useful at the end of an analysis to create human-readable tables.
Also, sometimes the analysis tool/function that we want to use needs data organized in this format.

The code below takes our tidy dataset, then creates one variable for each *Season* (like we started with).

```{r season_wide}
friends_tidy %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Season, values_from = Words)
```

Write the code to take the tidy dataset and create one variable for each *speaker*.
Call this code chunk `speaker_wide`.

### Dressing up tables

Explore the [`knitr::kable`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html) function and [`{kableExtra}`](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/).

A note before installing new packages: The HPC support team has [created a guide](https://hpcsupport.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/article/562429973) to help you avoid issues when working within the RStudio Server. The information here is useful to read **prior** to experiencing issues and I encourage you to read it now (1-2 minutes).

Use `knitr::kable` and `{kableExtra}` to dress up the `speaker_wide` table.



### The Curb Cut Effect

> When you design well for disability, you design well for everybody else.

[Gary Karp on "The Curb Cut Effect"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuIkFRZKfCU)

The curb cut is the ramp section of a side walk:

![Illustration of curb cuts by Jono Hey](https://images.prismic.io/sketchplanations/f103d71e-0ecb-4e78-bc02-e6dce18d0ed8_SP+718+-+The+curb-cut+effect.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.0.3&h=1887.9781420765028&w=1600&q=75&dpr=1)

Summary tables are great ways to present information.
However, there is a big disparity in what sighted users see and what a screen reader goes through for default tables.

Here is a short video (4:44) that showcases how screen readers interpret elements on a webpage:

**Update** your table in the previous section to add a *table caption*.


## Challenge: One more `pivot_wider`

While you used `pivot_wider` in this activity to make data "untidy", that is not the only time this function is useful.
Sometimes multiple variable names are stored in one column.
Data from the government usually has this issue.
For example, see:

```{r}
tidyr::us_rent_income
```

1. Restructure `us_rent_income` to have the following column names:

- `GEOID`
- `NAME`
- `income_estimate`
- `income_moe`
- `rent_estimate`
- `rent_moe`

  Hint: There are some additional arguments in `pivot_wider` that can assist with this. Look at the **Examples** in the help documentation.

2. Assign this to `us_wide`



Now, 

1. Re-restructure so that you have the original column names of:

- `GEOID`
- `NAME`
- `variable`
- `estimate`
- `moe`

  Hint: There are some additional arguments in `pivot_longer` that can assist with this. Look at the **Examples** in the help documentation.

2. Assign this to `us_long`
